# Introduction
Hello, Resya here! 23 years old girl in +8 GMT (East Borneo) timezone. I am a Tax Collector and software engineer. The 15th assignment is assigned to do CORS and Header.


# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration

This repository demonstrates how to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for two different front-end clients, Client X and Client Y, interacting with server-side application. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent unauthorized requests to a different domain. In this setup, we configure CORS headers to allow specific HTTP methods for each client.

## Client X

Client X is allowed to perform only **POST** and **GET** requests to the server.


## Client Y

Client Y is allowed to perform all HTTP methods: **GET**, **POST**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**.

## DEPLOYMENT

Client X: `http://localhost:5173`
Client Y: `http://localhost:5174`
